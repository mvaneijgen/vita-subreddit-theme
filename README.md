#Subreddit theme for /r/vita based on [/r/naut](https://github.com/Axel--/Naut-for-reddit)

I designed my version of what I think /r/vita could look like. It is designed for finding content easier and with readability in mind. This theme is really focused on content, so it focused on what you have to say.

The inspiration came from a comment on the banner of /r/vita
> the current one is too cluttered and off putting. A full half of the banner is anime girls I don't recognise which colours my image of the subreddit and console. - [melody-calling](http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/2ujxrg/three_years_and_countingthink_its_about_time_we/cocj8de)

For a long time I myself thought the image on the left of the banner was a crane... but that is just my disability, I think.

This is a theme for everyone, like the vita is for everyone. If your a heavy JRPG fan, you just love all those indies or if you're just here to relive your childhood and play all the old school games you never came around to. The theme will so what you have to say and what is going on in the vita community.

It is /r/vita that hooked me to Reddit, it is the frist subreddit I followed. So all I can do is give back to the community. Sharing is caring!

The theme is based on [/r/Naut](http://reddit.com/r/Naut) and thanks [/u/Cryptonaut](http://reddit.com/u/Cryptonaut)[Github](https://github.com/Axel--/Naut-for-reddit) for providing the assets.
